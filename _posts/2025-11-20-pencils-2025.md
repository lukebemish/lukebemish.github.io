title: 'A Year in Pencils: 2025'

I write quite a bit with wooden pencils: for the most part, I use them to take notes during lectures (in my standard atrocious handwriting) but also to annotate printed out papers as I read them, or to sketch out ideas in a notebook. Occasionally, I draw, though unfortunately not that much in the last few years.

In undergrad, my approach was to find random pencils on the ground, then use those till they ran out. In the last year though I've taken to actually shopping around for wooden pencils (whatever the stationery stores near me have in stock) and comparing them. So, without further ado, here are some of the pencils I found in the last year or so and thought were worth noting.

## Pencils

### Staedtler Tradition HB

A couple of years back I acquired (that is, found abandoned on the ground) a Staedtler Noris pencil, which I liked so much that I used it till it ran out. The Staedtler Tradition seems to be pretty similar. It looks identical, except instead of varnish that's yellow with black stripes it's red with black stripes. The pencil sharpens very nicely, leaving a pleasing curl of wood. The eraser has held up well enough, and for the most part erases cleanly. I'm sure I'd have a more nuanced opinion if I used these to draw more (since from what I can tell it's marketed as more of an art pencil than the Staedtler Noris) but for note-taking it's an all-around solid pencil. One worry is that the connection from the ferrule to the pencil body feels a bit "loose" on one of them but so far it's held up without issue so that may not actually be a problem.

The graphite is about average in terms of darkness for an HB pencil, though maybe darker than other European HB pencils I've seen. It feels exceptionally smooth to write with, and can leave a dark line without much pressure. It's worth noting that it doesn't seem to hold a point particularly well; I do feel like I end up sharpening it fairly often

### Camel HB

This one I wasn't sold on when I first saw it. What immediately jumped out to me was that _wacky_ looking eraser; there's no ferrule, it's just attached to the pencil body directly. It looks cool, and I suppose it means there's more usable eraser, but I wasn't sure it would really hold up to being dragged around in a backpack all the time and I figured I'd have to stick an eraser cap on it eventually.

The eraser hasn't broken yet. It's been in my backpack for a fair bit and seems to be holding up pretty well. It's also a very nice eraser! It erases cleanly, feels very "smooth" on the paper, and doesn't seem to smudge or leave gunk all over. The pencil itself is... alright. Nothing exceptional, it's a pretty boring old pencil. The lead isn't notably dark or light, and it holds a point for a reasonable amount of time. It's a bit obnoxious to sharpen (the wood seems to come off a bit weirdly, I'm not sure how else to describe it; it almost breaks off in small shards instead of coming off in a curl), but the resulting point is good. It's definitely fun to use, and the eraser design seems great even though I wasn't sold at first.

### Faber-Castell Grip 2001 HB

These are triangular pencils with a "grip" of small bumps in the varnish on the front two thirds of the pencil. The triangular pencil is actually surprisingly comfortable, but the grippy bits... not so much. I feel like they tend to dig into my hands after writing for a while, though it's better if I keep the pencil sharp. Maybe I grip pencils tighter than I ought to? The varnish itself is a bit weird too -- besides the grippy dots which look smooth and shiny, the actual pencil body is nearly matte and not smooth to the touch. It took some getting used to but I don't really mind it now; this is a very comfortable pencil to write with, ironically except for the grippy nubs.

The triangular shape means that the pencil has a large maximum radius than a normal hexagonal pencil in some parts of its cross-section which means that it _barely_ fits in my normal sharpener, but it does. The eraser is quite nice though rather soft and has been disappearing faster than those on my other pencils tend to. It sharpens well and can hold a fine point though the triangular shape means it's right at the edge of what would fit in my sharpener. It is probably a bit harder than what I'm used to in an HB pencil, but not to a degree that I notice when writing with it for a while.

### Musgrave Highlighting Pencils

I picked these up fairly recently for highlighting notes and highlighting papers as I read. They're... alright. The quality of construction is a bit sub-par; the varnish has a weird matte texture (which I'm fine with even if it took getting used to), but the almost-clear varnish over the black wood tends to look weird at the end with the varnish being lighter than the sharpened wood. While that's mostly an aesthetic complaint, the actual quality of the varnish is iffy too; at least one pencil in the set (they come in a set of 8) has a wacky wrinkle in the varnish in a line all the way down the side. The unsharpened end of the pencil is unfinished (no ferrule or varnish) which is pretty common for a colored pencil.

The pencils do what they advertise though; they're nice fluorescent-looking colors that still let you see whatever is underneath them quite easily, perfect for highlighting. I'd appreciate it if they were more erasable; while I'm sure a more abrasive erasure could make a dent, they're less erasable than some of the other colored pencils I've used, which is annoying when you don't want your eraser to also pull off whatever ink is under the color on a page. While I may be using these to annotate printed papers, I don't think I'll be using them in my notebook; I've noticed that they tend to smudge graphite under them when used, which is unfortunate.

### KUM Stenographer's Long Point Sharpener

This is the sharpener I use basically all the time. I like to keep my pencils exceptionally sharp, since I find that my hand gets tired the more pressure I need to write with and a really fine point can just glide over the page without any pressure whatsoever. This sharpener is good for that. It makes a very fine point, I've not had any issues with it breaking the lead, and it's quite small so I can just sharpen my pencils over the trash can (or even just over a cup previously filled with coffee, if I'm sitting in an auditorium) as needed. The downside to it being so small is that it's not exactly ergonomic to sharpen with, and that in practice you _will_ get graphite all over your hand while sharpening, but it's convenient enough and makes a nice enough point that I don't mind. It also feels quite sturdy, without any plastic bits. It sharpens to a _very_ long point, which is great since it means that the point stays fine for longer. I don't generally use it for colored pencils or the like as the resulting point is too fragile, though.
