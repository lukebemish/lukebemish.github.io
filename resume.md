## Research Experience

### CURI Summer Researcher

**Summer 2022** - *St Olaf College*

Explored the presence of neural responses to magnetic stimuli in the retina.

Compared approaches from information theory to classical approaches for quantifying neural response in retinal ganglion cells.

Designed a data pipeline to process neural spike data recorded from a multi electrode array and characterize its response to a known stimulus.

---

### Summer Intern at Air Force Research Labs

**Summer 2020-2021** - *Cold Atom Lab, Kirtland AFB, NM*

Simulated, built, and tested a high-current op-amp power supply for a cold atom system.

Developed and implemented a type of Bayesian optimization algorithm to more efficiently cool atoms in an atomic physics experiment.

---

### Research Science Institute

**July 2020** - *Center for Excellence in Education*

Designed a computational approach for Foldiak's algorithm, an alternative approach to categorization using neural-inspired unguided learning, for use without prior knowledge of the probabilities of features.
