## Research Experience

### CURI Summer Researcher, *St Olaf College*
##### Summer 2022

Explored the presence of neural responses to magnetic stimuli in the retina.

Compared approaches from information theory to classical approaches for quantifying neural response in retinal ganglion cells.

Designed a data pipeline to process neural spike data recorded from a multi electrode array and characterize its response to a known stimulus.

---

### Summer Intern at Air Force Research Labs, *Cold Atom Lab, Kirtland AFB, NM*
##### Summer 2020-2021

Simulated, built, and tested a high-current op-amp power supply for a cold atom system.

Developed and implemented a type of Bayesian optimization algorithm to more efficiently cool atoms in an atomic physics experiment.

---

### Research Science Institute, *Center for Excellence in Education*
##### July 2020

Designed a computational approach for Foldiak's algorithm, an alternative approach to categorization using neural-inspired unguided learning, for use without prior knowledge of the probabilities of features.
