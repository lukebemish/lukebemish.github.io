## Research Experience

### CURI Summer Researcher
**Summer 2024 – Spring 2025** — *St. Olaf College* — Mechanisms of auditory eavesdropping in *Ormia ochracea*, a parasitoid fly

Investigated how flies adapt to changes in host song patterns through behavioral experiments comparing different populations

Recorded from auditory neurons and conducted behavioral experiments to determine what information flies extract from host cricket song patterns

Collaborated with other students to conduct research on and maintain several fly populations

---

### Summer Undergraduate Researcher

**Summer 2023** — *St. Olaf College* — Dynamics of Costa Rican singing mouse song structure

Characterized differences in note timing between social and solitary contexts

Built a low-parameter model of note timings

Investigated social-context-dependent sources of variance in song length

---

### CURI Summer Researcher

**Summer 2022** — *St. Olaf College* — Potential retinal mechanisms for magnetoreception in birds and turtles

Analyzed neural data recorded from a multi-electrode array for which we were unsure of how our information of interest may have been encoded

Located and mitigated sources of electromagnetic noise in our experimental setup

Assembled a data pipeline capable of analyzing the large amounts of neural data collected

---

### Summer Intern at Air Force Research Labs

**Summer 2020-2021** — *Cold Atom Lab, Kirtland AFB, NM*

Simulated, built, and tested a high-current op-amp power supply for a cold atom system

Developed and implemented a type of Bayesian optimization algorithm to more efficiently cool atoms in an atomic physics experiment

---

### Research Science Institute

**July 2020** — *Center for Excellence in Education*

Designed a computational approach for Foldiak's algorithm, an alternative approach to categorization using neural-inspired unguided learning, for use without prior knowledge of the probabilities of features
